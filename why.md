# Why TAGI

**TEXT MADE BY BING AI-CHAT**

TAGI is a new algorithm for training neural networks. It is based on the idea of using the information of the gradient of the loss function to train the network. This is in contrast to the standard approach of using the gradient of the loss function to update the parameters of the network. The TAGI algorithm is very simple and can be implemented in a few lines of code. It is also very efficient and can be used to train very large networks.
